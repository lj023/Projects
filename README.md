# Data Science Projects
I am currently in the process of updating the projects marked as 'TBU' and will share them once they are finalized. I am open to any comments and advice.

# Projects Descriptions
#### [Predicting Heart Disease Risk Factors: A Data-Driven Approach](https://github.com/lj023/Projects/tree/main/Predicting%20Heart%20Disease):
In this project, we aimed to predict the likelihood of future heart disease in patients by utilizing a comprehensive dataset collected from multiple hospitals. Through meticulous data preprocessing, feature selection, and the construction of a k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) classifier, we achieved a significant 84.27% accuracy on the test set. This project contributes to the advancement of healthcare solutions and the early identification of cardiovascular risk factors, potentially saving lives and mitigating premature deaths attributed to cardiovascular diseases.
#### [Credit Card User Grouping: Tailor Strategic Analysis and Engagement](https://github.com/lj023/Projects/tree/main/Credit%20Card%20Customer%20Segmentation): 
We conducted a data analysis and customer segmentation project using K-Means clustering. Throughout the project, we explored a customer dataset, carried out data preprocessing, found the optimal number of clusters, and interpreted cluster characteristics. The insights gained from our analysis informed the development of tailored business strategies for each cluster. The project includes code for data preprocessing, visualization, clustering, and interpretation, offering a practical resource for understanding customer segmentation and making informed decisions.
#### [Precision in Forecasting Medical Insurance Costs: Advanced Modeling and Analytics](https://github.com/lj023/Projects/tree/main/Predicting%20Insurance%20Costs): 
This project has successfully predicted medical insurance costs using a dataset that includes medical insurance bills and patient demographics. Through data exploration, we addressed skewness in the outcome variable, selected pertinent features, and built and evaluated a linear regression model. Our analysis has revealed the factors impacting medical costs, including the influence of extreme values and the effectiveness of log transformation. Future steps include exploring complex modeling techniques and improving predictions for exceptionally high charges.
#### [Stochastic Gradient Descent on Linear Regression](https://github.com/lj023/Projects/tree/main/Stochastic%20Gradient%20Descent%20on%20Linear%20Regression): TBU
#### [Classifying Heart Disease](https://github.com/lj023/Projects/tree/main/Classifying%20Heart%20Disease): TBU
#### [Predicting Employee Productivity Using Tree Models](https://github.com/lj023/Projects/tree/main/Predicting%20Employee%20Productivity%20Using%20Tree%20Models): TBU
#### [Optimizing Model Prediction](https://github.com/lj023/Projects/tree/main/Optimizing%20Model%20Prediction): TBU
