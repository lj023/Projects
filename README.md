# Data Science Projects
These are guided projects for the online course 'Data Scientist in Python' offered by Dataquest. The following provides a summary of the projects. I am currently in the process of updating the projects marked as 'TBU' and will share them once they are finalized. I am open to any comments and advice.

# Projects Descriptions
#### [Predicting Heart Disease](https://github.com/lj023/Projects/blob/main/Predicting%20Heart%20Disease/Predicting%20Heart%20Disease.ipynb):
In this project, we aimed to predict the likelihood of future heart disease in patients by utilizing a comprehensive dataset collected from multiple hospitals. Through meticulous data preprocessing, feature selection, and the construction of a k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) classifier, we achieved a significant 84.27% accuracy on the test set. This project contributes to the advancement of healthcare solutions and the early identification of cardiovascular risk factors, potentially saving lives and mitigating premature deaths attributed to cardiovascular diseases.
